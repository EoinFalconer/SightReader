3. Navigate to Main.java in the project explorer and run that file.\
4. Wait for the GUI to launch and then click the prompt to upload a .bmp file. Navigate to the project and upload one of the bmp files in the \'91Samples\'92 folder. \
5. The project will begin to run. Run time is around 3-4 minutes and progress can be seen in the console.\
6. Once the project finishes. The GUI will expand to show the voice parts which can be played by clicking the buttons as indicated. \
7. The MusicXML files will give a nicer listening experience and can be found in the project directory. These can be uploaded to an online player such as https://www.soundslice.com/musicxml-viewer/ for playback and a good visualisation for comparison to the original .bmp file.\
